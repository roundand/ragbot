# Build an LLM RAG Chatbot With LangChain
I'm working through the [realpython.com Build and LLM RAG chatbot with langchain tutorial](https://realpython.com/build-llm-rag-chatbot-with-langchain/) as part of a project to learn Python and understand AI developments.

## Notes to Self
I'm using venv to manage the virtual environment, and coding in Windows. The following would probably be obvious to any experienced Python developer.

### To create a virtual environment ```venv```, as a one-off step
```python -m venv venv```

### To activate the virtual environment ```venv``` (Windows command prompt or PowerShell)
```
PS> venv\Scripts\activate
(venv) PS>
```

### To install dependencies, in Windows (one-off, or any time you merge an updated requirements.txt)
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### To update requirements.txt (any time you've added or updated a dependency)
```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
